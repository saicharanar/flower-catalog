        Ageratum, (whiteweed in the USA), is a genus of 40[3] to 60 tropical and
        warm temperate flowering annuals and perennials from the family
        Asteraceae, tribe Eupatorieae. Most species are native to Central
        America and Mexico but four are native to the United States. They form
        tussocks or small hills. They grow to a height of 30 in. The opposite
        leaves are cordate or oval, hairy or tomentose. The margins are slightly
        toothed or serrate. The leaves form compact clusters. The fluffy flowers
        are lavender-blue, pink, lilac, or white; and spread in small compound
        umbels. They give small, dry fruits.
